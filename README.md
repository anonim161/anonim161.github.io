### Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird has a gameplay with 2D graphics. The goal of the game is to control the flight of a bird that continuously moves between rows of green pipes. When you encounter them, the game ends. Control is performed by touching the screen, in which the bird makes a small jump up. In the absence of jerks, the bird falls due to gravity, and the game also ends. Points are awarded for each successful flight between two tubes. The gameplay remains the same throughout the game.

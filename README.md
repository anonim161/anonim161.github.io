### Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird has a gameplay with 2D graphics. The goal of the game is to control the flight of a bird that continuously moves between rows of green pipes. When you encounter them, the game ends. Control is performed by touching the screen, in which the bird makes a small jump up. In the absence of jerks, the bird falls due to gravity, and the game also ends. Points are awarded for each successful flight between two tubes. The gameplay remains the same throughout the game.

### Ball And Platform

The player controls a small platform-a racket that can be moved horizontally from one wall to another, substituting it for the ball, not letting it fall down. The impact of the ball on the brick leads to the destruction of the brick itself. After all the bricks in this level are destroyed, you will move to the next level with a new set of bricks. There is also some variety: certain bricks need to be hit several times, sometimes there are flying enemies that push the ball away, hitting some bricks causes them to fall out of the prize capsules-the prize is activated if you catch such a capsule with a racket.
